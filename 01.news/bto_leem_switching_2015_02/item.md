**Control of polarization is a key issue in research on ferroelectrics materials and its possible use for low-consumption electronic devices. A ferroelectric material spontaneously show microscopic domains with different polarization directions to minimize its energy. We showed very low energy electrons generated using a Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) can switch the ferroelectric polarziation in a reversible manner. The use of external charges (here electrons) to alter ferroelectric polarization gives a new direction to functionalize ferroelectric oxides.**
